# SweetStore
A sweet store simulation using OOP in Python.

This code consists of a superclass Sweet that has 4 subclasses Chocolate, Liquorice, Gummy, Sour. Each one of them has a display() method and has a make() method, but differ on how they work, especially make().

We also have another class that is called Ingredient, that is for the ingredients that are used when trying to make a sweet.

And for the important part, the Sweetstore that manages the sale, creation and managing the inventories for the sweets and ingredients.

And after that we used unittest to test the classes and their methods
